Day 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective:
	Understand the structure, quality, and patterns in the U.S. Flight Delay & Cancellation dataset before modeling, and define a 	leakage-safe prediction setup.

Work done:

	Loaded and worked with a large, real-world flight dataset (~1.5M sampled rows)

	Inspected schema, data types, and column meanings to distinguish:

	scheduled vs actual flight information

	Defined the prediction problem clearly:

	Predict whether a flight will be delayed (>15 min) using only information available before departure

	Identified noisy and sparse columns (e.g., delay reason fields with heavy nulls)


Analyzed time-based patterns:

	Month

	Day of week

	Scheduled departure hour

	Explored route-level and airline-level distributions

	Checked class balance for delayed vs non-delayed flights

	Derived initial insights to guide feature engineering (time features, frequency patterns)

Outcome:

	Strong understanding of dataset behavior and real-world constraints

	Clear separation between exploratory insights and modeling decisions

	Solid foundation for feature engineering on Day 2
